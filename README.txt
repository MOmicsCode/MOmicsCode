# 1. This is sample of my code in R programming language for analysis of counted omics data from NGS sequencing. 
# 2. Numbers in .csv files represent the amounts of oligopeptides in sequenced samples
# 3. The goal of the uploaded code is to point oligopeptides read significantly higher than in control samples (assuming log-normal distribution of samples and adjusting probabilities for multiple hypothese with fdr method).
# 4. Code is designed to be downloaded along with files to a directory, and the address of this directory needs to be put in the code (6th line).
